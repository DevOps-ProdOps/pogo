NAME
    Pogo - Run commands on many hosts in a controlled manner

DESCRIPTION
    Pogo is a highly scalable system for running arbitrary commands on many
    hosts in a controlled manner.

    It is mostly used for quick mass software deployments on server farms
    while making sure only an allowed number of nodes are upgraded in
    parallel to ensure business continuity.

  Project Setup
    Pogo is hosted on Github at

        https://github.com/ytoolshed/pogo

    The latest stable version can be found on the master branch. The project
    is automatically being tested on every commit, using travis-ci's
    service:

        http://travis-ci.org/#!/ytoolshed/pogo

  Architecture
    Pogo consists of several components, which can be all running on the
    same system, or, in order to scale it, be replicated and even be
    installed on many distributed hosts. Those components are

    Client
        Users submit jobs to pogo using the client, which in turn contacts
        the API.

    API Takes requests via HTTP from the client and forwards them to a
        dispatcher.

    Dispatcher
        Takes job requests from the API, figures out constraints, and
        determines single tasks the job consists of. It then assigns tasks
        to workers, watches their individual completion and keeps track of
        overall job completion. Dispatchers can be queried by the API to
        determine the status of a given job.

    Worker
        Takes a task (like "ssh to a host and run this command") from the
        dispatcher, executes it and reports back the result. Can handle many
        tasks concurrently.

  Security
    To make sure dispatchers and workers communicate over secure channels,
    and enable them to authenticate each other (is a connecting worker
    really an authorized worker, or is the dispatcher it's connecting to
    really an authorized dispatcher?), Pogo uses SSL server and client
    certs. See Pogo::Security for details.

NAME
    pogo-one - All-In-One Pogo

SYNOPSIS
        $ cat one.conf
        tag:
          # no tags
        sequence:
          - host3
          - host2
          - host1
    
          # specify two hosts 1 and 2, but config says to run them in 
          # reverse order
        $ pogo-one --password --hosts host1,host2 \
            --config one.conf --command 'date'
        Password: ****
        host2: Running target
        host2: Success
        host1: Running target
        host1: Success

DESCRIPTION
    "pogo-one" is a simple utility that loads all the usually distributed
    Pogo components into one single process and runs it from the command
    line. In this way, you can test Pogo functions like constraints and
    sequences without having to set up the different components of an entire
    production system. It is mainly used for testing, but also helps with
    small deployment jobs.

  PASSWORDS
    By default, "pogo-one" assumes that you have access to the target boxes
    without having to type your password or your ssh keyring's passphrase.
    To have "pogo-one" collect the password and use it to sign in on the
    target, use the "--password" options

        $ pogo-one --password ...
        Password: ****
        ...

  OPTIONS
    "--config file"
        Location of configuration file that defineds Pogo tags, sequences,
        and constraints.

    "--password"
        If specified, c<pogo-one> will collect the user's target password at
        a command line prompt, and use it to log into the target machines.

    "--hosts"
        All hosts to run the command on. Order and parallelism is determined
        by the configuration file.

    "--commands"
        The command to run on all hosts.
